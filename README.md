# Audio Reactivity Experimental Dojo

Next.js based app using Three.js. 
I'm making it public very early on because i want to build in public.
There are 3 audio files in the `public` dir, which are songs that I made with GenAI, and also a customized Gemini model to help me write cool lyrics in Japanese. Fun! ðŸ‘½

Run: `npm run dev`
